# About Me

- 👋 Hello there! I’m [@Arkiralor](https://www.github.com/Arkiralor), a software developer for Guwahati in the Northeast-Indian state of Assam.
	
	- Personally I deal in backends in Python via Django/FastAPI but I am not above delving into systems engineering and obviously I am constantly looking for ways to fulfil that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to draw/paint again.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects that can help people in the long run.
- 📫 You can reach me via [email](mailto:prithoo11335@gmail.com) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prithoo11335/)
