- 👋 Hello there! I’m [@Arkiralor](https://www.github.com/Arkiralor), a software developer for Guwahati in the Northeast-Indian state of Assam.
	
	- Personally I deal in backends in Python via Django/FastAPI but I am not above delving into systems engineering and obviously I am constantly looking for ways to fulfil that.
- 🌱 Right now, learning how to draw/paint _again_.
